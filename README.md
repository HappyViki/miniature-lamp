This is a pointless project, inspired by JAMstack_conf

## Setup

Make sure you have [node][node] and [npm][npm] installed.  
Run:  
```
npm install
```

## Development
### Linting
* JavaScript
    * `npm run lint`
    * `npm run lintfix`
        * This fixes smaller issues that do not need human intervention
* CSS
    * Same as above (JS and CSS are combined, for now)
